### recap
naive soln: O(n^3)
improved: O(n^2)
(in slides)

Sorting makes finding things faster
## Merge Sort

### EX. Internet Search Engines

### Type: Divide and Conquer
Break down and solve smaller piece of original problem
- Divide: Divide input data
- Recur: Solve sub problems
- Conquer: Combine solutions
Base cases are 0 or 1

EX. Biology?

Similar to heap sort
- O(n log(n)
BUT
- no priority queue
- accesses elements sequentially
