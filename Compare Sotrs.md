## Decision Trees

### Height
height = log(n!)
leaves = n!

## Lower Bound
Big Omega(n * log(n))

First thing to find when trying to find time  complexity:
1. Find T(n) aka runtime(start from primitive ops, define constant runtime for 1 primitive op)


# Divide & Conquer
A general algorithm design paradigm
1. Divide
2. Conquer
3. Combine
