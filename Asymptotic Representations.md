## Primitive operations
Each type has their own constant time
Each CPU runs primitive ops different duration but consistent with itself

## Average vs worst case
Average is hard
Worst is best because it is acceptable for all cases

## Recursion
Need recurrence equation

## Big O
Tight Upper bound
Alg takes max time and space
Be mindful of hidden constants

## Big Omega
Tight Lower bound
Alg takes min time and space
## Big Theta
Tight Exact bound

## Little O
Loose upper bound

## Little Omega
Loose lower bound

### Asymptotically better 
Means comparing solely on the operation. No hidden constants involved
